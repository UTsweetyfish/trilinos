Trilinos for Debian
-------------------

The sources are fetched from the public Git repository of Trilinos, cf.
<https://github.com/trilinos/trilinos>.

Most changes previously made through the old Debian package
http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/trilinos.html are now included upstream.
Notably, this does not include the library rename from "teuchos" to
"trilinos_teuchos" (and likewise for all subpackages).
